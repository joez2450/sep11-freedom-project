# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Joe Zheng**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study Kaboom in order to help me make an educational platformer game to help people academically while also engaging them in an effort to combat lower attention spans and doomscrolling.

To pair alongside JavaScript, I learned Kaboom as my third-party tool throughout the year to help me make the game.

I worked alongside a partner on this project. As we were constructing our game, I collaborated with my parter so that we could merge our works in the end with different features that we worked on individually.
