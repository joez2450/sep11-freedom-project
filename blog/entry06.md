# Entry 6
##### 5/16/25

Ever since the last blog, I have modified my MVP with Kyle with Beyond MVP suggestions that were given to us during a gallery walk activity in class.



### EDP
Currently in the Engineering Design Process, I have already completed the seventh stage which was to improve the our products as needed. I added a new checkpoint feature where users could teleport to either their current or previous acheived levels so it reduces redundancy of having to restart the game if you answer a question incorrectly. I have also completed the eighth stage: Communicate Your Results. I have created presentation slides and an elevator pitch to present to the class and also at the Expo.

### Takeaways/Skills

####
While creating presentation slides, I needed to find a way with Kyle to effectively convey our project without large chunks of texts. Our goal was to be minimalistic in the amount of text we would write. We spent a chunk of time planning out the outline of our presentation slides. Afterward, we created each slides accordingly to our plan, putting no more than 3 bullet points per slides.

#### Less is More
During the Expo showcase, Kyle and I learned that elevator pitches had to be condensed to ideally 3-4 slides while containing small text but that also captured the essence of the project. While we presented, I realized that we had a little too much slides to present within the one minute time mark, which limited the amount of time we could have delegated towards our live demonstration of the platformer game.
